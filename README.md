# Gender_detection
# This Module is from scratch using deep learning with keras, cvlib and opencv.

# The keras model is created by using Keras Sequential model from scratch and training it on around 2200 images(1100 on each class). Face region is cropped by applying face-detection using cvlib on the images of the dataset. It achieved around 99.8% train accuracy and 94% test accuracy(20% of the dataset is used in testing over the model
